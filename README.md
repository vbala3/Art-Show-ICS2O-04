This is a video game I created for my computer science class. The game is a typical, fairly simple and straightforward shooter game. As such, some of the code is based off of other similar games such as the Space Invader's coding challenge done on the coding train. I used that as my base code and refactored it into my own creation. Below I have linked some of the previous versions of this game, each one marking the progress I have made to end up here. Note that these are all links to p5.js as that was where I created my video game. The final version is the last link, and it is playable on GitHub. <br />
[Version 1:](https://editor.p5js.org/vbala3/sketches/MAaq9-ucX) Fairly simple, has a main character that can shoot, as well as some randomly spawning enemies and even a health bar, but there is no collision whatsoever <br />
